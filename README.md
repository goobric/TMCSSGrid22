## What is CSS Grid?

### CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives us to easily align items and create two dimensional layouts

- Grid & Flexbox are both part of CSS and can both be used in similar ways
- Flexbox was created first and has a bit more browser compatibility
- Brad would highly recommend learning both Grid & Flexbox
