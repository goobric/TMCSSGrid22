## What is CSS Grid?

### CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives us to easily align items and create two dimensional layouts

- Grid & Flexbox are both part of CSS and can both be used in similar ways
- Flexbox was created first and has a bit more browser compatibility
- Brad would highly recommend learning both Grid & Flexbox

### Use CSS Grid for the Overall Layout of a website
### Align inner elements with Flexbox

## Grid Containers & Grid Items
the Grid Container is the element that holds Grid Items. Grid Items are **direct children** of Grid Containers. A Container is created with _display: grid_

### Grid Container Properties
- grid-template columns
- grid-template-rows
- grid-gap
- grid-auto-rows
- grid-auto-columns
- grid-template-areas
- justify-content
- align-items

### Grid Item Properties
- grid-column
- grid-row
- grid-area
- align-self
- justify-self

**Flexbox** is one-dimensional and can be either row _OR_ column

**CSS Grid** allows two-dimensional layouts with rows _AND_ columns, and SPAN layouts
